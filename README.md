# Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) versus Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) Neural Networks 

The following code implementation compares LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) neural networks to predict the future closing price of a publically traded (NYSE) company based multivariate inputs (Open, High, and Low prices). 

All models are assessed in terms of the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) scores for a baseline model and optimized model (differing in terms of epochs and hidden neurons). 

After further optimization, the following implementation could theoretically be utilized for financial forecasting applications.
